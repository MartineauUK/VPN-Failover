# VPN-Failover
ASUS Router Monitor VPN Client connection status/thoughput performance and switch or restart VPN Client

This script can monitor the connection status of a VPN Client interface, and if the status is found to be unacceptable, can perform one of the following:

		1. Report on the status of the nominated VPN Client connection
		2. Restart the VPN Client
		3. Start a different VPN Client configuration
		4. Restart the same VPN Client instance with a different server/port/protocol*
		
The script will attempt to use cURL to retrieve data via the VPN Client tunnel except in the case of site-site VPN tunnel where the remote site has enabled 'LAN ONLY' in which you will need to specify the 'pingonly=' directive to use PING rather than cURL to determine the state of the connection.

The easiest method (to implement the script) to monitor a VPN Client connection is to simply use cru (cron) schedule(s)

	e.g. 	Every 60 minutes @5 minutes past the hour
		cru "5 */1 * * *" /jffs/scripts/VPN_Failover.sh once
			
However, using a static schedule, isn't very flexible, as suppose the VPN Client is legitimately DOWN, then unless the cru (cron) schedule isn't stopped, the VPN Client connection will be restored, which may be inappropriate.

A better solution is to only enable the monitoring when the VPN Client is manually started, and to cease monitoring when the VPN Client is manually terminated.
This method will require the openvpn-event triggers vpnclientX-route-up/vpnclientX-up and vpnclientX-route-pre-down scripts to be implemented.

e.g. Two minutes after VPN Client 1 is started, monitor the status of VPN Client 1, every 60 minutes
	
		/jffs/scripts/vpnclient1-route-pre-up
		
		VPN_ID=${dev:4:1}
		logger -st "($(basename $0))" $$ "Requesting VPN Failover monitor with 2 min delay....."
		/jffs/scripts/VPN_Failover.sh "$VPN_ID" "delay=120" "interval=3600" &

and subsequently needs to be terminated by openvpn-event vpnclientX-route-pre-down (unless the termination is requested by this script)

		/jffs/scripts/vpnclientX-route-pre-down
		
		VPN_ID=${dev:4:1}
		VPNFAILOVER="/tmp/vpnclient"$VPN_ID"-VPNFailover"
		# Also rely on the VPN_Failover.sh to test for the existence of the VPNFailover semaphore BEFORE it attempts a restart!
		if [ -z "$(grep "NOKILL" $VPNFAILOVER)" ];then
			PID=$(cat $VPNFAILOVER)
			[ "$PID" != "NOKILL" ] && kill $PID
			rm $VPNFAILOVER
			logger -st "($(basename $0))" $$ "VPN Failover Monitor self-destruct requested....." $VPNFAILOVER "RC="$?  # RC=1 means file was already deleted
		fi

OpenVPN is quite capable of monitoring its connection, and can restart with a different server/port/protocol by including the appropriate directives.

One unique feature of the script is its ability to measure the time taken for a file transfer to occur, and (if convenient) restart the connection

	e.g. If the 433Byte cURL transfer rate is <1000 Bytes per second, no (disruptive) VPN Switch is performed during 'office' hours 9-5

	./VPN_Failover 3 forcesmall curlrate=1000 verbose noswitch=08:59-17:00
